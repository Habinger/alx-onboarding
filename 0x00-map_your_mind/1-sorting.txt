Let the numbers be in variables A B and C 
if A>C
    exchange the values of A and C
if A > B
    exchange the values of A and B 
//now that we know the smallest value is assigned to a all thats left is b and c
if B > C 
    exchange the values of B and C 
return A, B, C 
//This will always return them in ascending order.
